**Course Description:**  

This course is a continuation of STT 5811 which introduces students at the post-calculus level to statistical concepts, applications, and theory. Topics include: comparisons with categorical and numerical data, statistical significance, sampling and sampling distributions, and randomized experiments. Statistical concepts will be developed through simulations, and applications will focus on statistical problem-solving.  

**Course Objectives:**

1.  Students will use a reproducible research work flow.
2.  Students will improve their technology expertise.
3.  Students will learn how to construct and test hypotheses using both classical and randomization approaches.
4.  Students will learn how to construct confidence intervals using both classical and bootstrap approaches.
5.  Students will learn how to generate random and simple random samples and their relationships to permutation and bootstrap distributions.
6.  Students will learn how to work with named sampling distributions (*t*, *F*, binomial, chi-square, hypergeometric, and normal).
7.  Students will learn the scope of inferential conclusions for numerous scenarios (experiments, observational studies, etc.). 


**Course Text:**

[_Investigating Statistical Concepts, Applications, and Methods, Third Edition_ (ISCAMIII)](http://www.rossmanchance.com/iscam3/) by Beth L. Chance and Allan J. Rossman

**Optional References:**

[_Reproducible Research with R and RStudio, Second Edition_](https://github.com/christophergandrud/Rep-Res-Book) by Christopher Gandrud

[_R Graphics Cookbook_](http://www.amazon.com/R-Graphics-Cookbook-Winston-Chang/dp/1449316956) by Winston Chang - Available via `SafariBooksOnline` through the Appalachian State University [library](http://library.appstate.edu/). 


**Course Grading:**

* There will be a midterm and final exam which will each count for 25% of the course grade.
* 40% of the course grade will come from quizzes.
* 10% of the course grade will come from participation (attendance, participation in discussion in-class and/or online).
* Up to 10 points may be added to your final course average for an excellent compilation of all homework assignments and class notes in a single hyperlinked `*.html` document.  

**Piazza:**

This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com.

**How To Get Unstuck**

If you have a course related question, please ask your question on [piazza](https://piazza.com/class/ij30sna9alj1pq).  Your classmates may have the same question or may answer your question before I can provide an answer.  Well constructed questions will elicit answers more rapidly than poorly constructed questions.  This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFaWxxzouCY&list=PLjTlxb-wKvXNSDfcKPFH2gzHGyjpeCZmJ&index=3) provides some background on asking questions.  This stackoverflow thread details how to create a [minimal R reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/5963610#5963610). Please read [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Raymond and Rick Moen and heed their advice.
